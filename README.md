## üé® My Projects
- [Rhythmrealm](https://rhythmrealm.onrender.com/) - Collaboratively developed a Spotify clone within one week using Python, React/Redux, Node, and AWS, complemented with HTML and CSS. Engineered to allow users to upload, manage, and play songs and albums, also it features comprehensive search capabilities for songs and artists and supports real-time audio processing and display with react-h5-audio-player.
- [Cozy Corners](https://airbnb-api-project-whvo.onrender.com/) - Inspired by Airbnb, this web application utilizes PostgreSQL, Vanilla JavaScript, React/Redux, HTML, and CSS. Designed with a normalized relational database schema for optimal data storage and retrieval, it features JWT-based authentication to secure user sessions and protect sensitive data. Additionally, it supports comprehensive CRUD operations on rental listings through robust RESTful API endpoints developed for effective user and property management.
